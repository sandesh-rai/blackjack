## Play the game üéÆüÉè

## Rules/ Mechanics
- Player and dealer start with 2 cards each
- Player starts and can choose to hit as long as they don't exceed a score of 21
- When player chooses to stand, dealer draws until their score is equal to or greater than the player's score
- When either the player or dealer exceeds a score of 21, they will 'bust'
- If the score of the player and dealer are equal and less than 21, there will be a 'push'
- Rule variation: any number of cards in a hand with total score of 21 counts as a blackjack (whereas typically only a hand of 2 cards do)
